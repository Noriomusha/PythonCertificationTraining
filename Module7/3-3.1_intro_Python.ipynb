    "\n",
    "There are situations in which you want your code to continue execution or display a friendly message to the user despite an error that you might or might not anticipate in advance. It is possible to modify your program to handle specific exceptions and to continue execution without stopping. The process is called exception handling, and can be done using a `try...except` statement with the following syntax:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling multiple exceptions\n",
    "Your program can raise exceptions of different types. You can use the `try...except` statement to handle each of the types differently by adding another `except` clause and its associated code at the end:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType_1:\n",

    "    code block to handle exception of type ExceptionType_2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised, the rest of the code inside the `try` block is ignored and the execution jumps to the relevant `except` code block and executes it. Then the program continues normal execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling unexpected exceptions\n",
    "If your code encounters an exception you did not anticipate or explicitly handle, your program will stop execution and display an error message. You can handle unexpected exceptions using an `except` clause without specifying the exception type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    code that may raise an exception\n",
    "except ExceptionType_1:\n",
    "    code block to handle exception of type ExceptionType_1\n",
    "except ExceptionType_2:\n",
    "    code block to handle exception of type ExceptionType_2\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    code block to handle unexpected exceptions of any type\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling exceptions raised by other functions\n",
    "When a function raises an exception without handling it, the caller function must handle the exception or raise it up another level. For example, the `sqrt` function from the `math` module expect a positive number for an argument. Passing a negative number to `sqrt` will raise a `ValueError` exception. The `sqrt` function doesn't handle the exception internally, so your code should handle it or raise it to an upper level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error messages\n",
    "The error message associated with a raised exception can be stored in a variable using (`as exception_object:`) in the `except` clause, right after the exception type:\n",
